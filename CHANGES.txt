Changes
=======

All issue numbers are relative to https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/issues.

1.10a1 (2024-03-01)
-------------------

Python version:

Fiona 1.10 will be compatible with Numpy versions 1 and 2 and will require
Python version 3.9 or higher.

New features:

- Python openers can now support discovery of auxiliary "sidecar" files like
  .aux.xml, .msk, and .tfw files for GeoTIFFs (#1331). Additionally, filesystem
  objects, such as those from fsspec, can be used as openers. This will become
  the recommended usage, supplanting the use of single file openers.

Bug fixes:

- Use of pkg_resources in test_rio_info.py has been eliminated.
- gzip, tar, and zip archive URIs containing drive letters were not always
  parsed properly on Windows, but are now (#1334).

1.9.5 (2023-10-11)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Expand keys in schema mismatch exception, resolving #1278.
- Preserve the null properties and geometry of a Feature when serializing
  (#1276).

Packaging:

* Builds now require Cython >= 3.0.2 (#1276).
* PyPI wheels include GDAL 3.6.4, PROJ 9.0.1, and GEOS 3.11.2.
* PyPI wheels include curl 8.4.0, addressing CVE-2023-38545 and CVE-38546.
* PyPI wheels are now available for Python 3.12.

1.9.4.post1 (2023-05-23)
------------------------

Extraneous files were unintentionally packaged in the 1.9.4 wheels. This post1
release excludes them so that wheel contents are as in version 1.9.3.

1.9.4 (2023-05-16)
------------------

- The performance of Feature.from_dict() has been improved (#1267).
- Several sources of meaningless log messages from fiona._geometry about NULL
  geometries are avoided (#1264).
- The Parquet driver has been added to the list of supported drivers and will
  be available if your system's GDAL library links libarrow. Note that fiona
  wheels on PyPI do not include libarrow as it is rather large.
- Ensure that fiona._vendor modules are found and included.
- Bytes type feature properties are now hex encoded when serializing to GeoJSON
  (#1263).
- Docstrings for listdir and listlayers have been clarified and harmonized.
- Nose style test cases have been converted to unittest.TestCase (#1256).
- The munch package used by fio-filter and fio-calc is now vendored and patched
  to remove usage of the deprecated pkg_resources module (#1255).

1.9.3 (2023-04-10)
------------------

- Rasterio CRS objects are compatible with the Collection constructor and are
  now accepted (#1248).
- Enable append mode for fio-load (#1237).
- Reading a GeoJSON with an empty array property can result in a segmentation
  fault since version 1.9.0. This has been fixed (#1228).

1.9.2 (2023-03-20)
------------------

- Get command entry points using importlib.metadata (#1220).
- Instead of warning, transform_geom() raises an exception when some points
  can't be reprojected unless the caller opts in to partial reprojection. This
  restores the behavior of version 1.8.22.
- Add support for open options to all CLI commands that call fiona.open
  (#1215).
- Fix a memory leak that can occur when iterating over a dataset using strides
  (#1205).
- ZipMemoryFile now supports zipped GDB data (#1203).

1.9.1 (2023-02-09)
------------------

- Log a warning message when identically named fields are encountered (#1201).
- Avoid dependence on listdir order in tests (#1193).
- Prevent empty geometries arrays from appearing in __geo_interface__ (#1197).
- setuptools added to pyproject.toml. Its pkg_resources module is used by the
  CLI (#1191).

1.9.0 (2023-01-30)
------------------

- CITATION.txt has been replaced by a new CITATION.cff file and the credits
  have been updated.
- In setup.py the distutils (deprecated) logger is no longer used.

1.9b2 (2023-01-22)
------------------

- Add Feature.__geo_interface__ property (#1181).
- Invalid creation options are filtered and ignored (#1180).
- The readme doc has been shortened and freshened up, with a modern example for
  version 1.9.0 (#1174).
- The Geometry class now provides and looks for __geo_interface__ (#1174).
- The top level fiona module now exports Feature, Geometry, and Properties
  (#1174).
- Functions that take Feature or Geometry objects will continue to take dicts
  or objects that provide __geo_interface__ (#1177). This reverses the
  deprecation introduced in 1.9a2.
- Python ignores SIGPIPE by default. By never catching BrokenPipeError via
  `except Exception` when, for example, piping the output of rio-shapes to
  the Unix head program, we avoid getting an unhandled BrokenPipeError message
  when the interpreter shuts down (#2689).

1.9b1 (2022-12-13)
------------------

New features:

* Add listdir and listlayers method to io.MemoryFile (resolving #754).
* Add support for TIN and triangle geometries (#1163).
* Add an allow_unsupported_drivers option to fiona.open() (#1126).
* Added support for the OGR StringList field type (#1141).

Changes and bug fixes:

* Missing and unused imports have been added or removed.
* Make sure that errors aren't lost when a collection can't be saved properly
  (#1169).
* Ensure that ZipMemoryFile have the proper GDAL name after creation so that we
  can use listdir() (#1092).
* The fiona._loading module, which supports DLL loading on Windows,
  has been moved into __init__.py and is no longer used anywhere else (#1168).
* Move project metadata to pyproject.toml (#1165).
* Update drvsupport.py to reflect new format capabilities in GDAL 3.6.0
  (#1122).
* Remove debug logging from env and _env modules.

1.9a3 (2022-10-17)
------------------

Packaging:

* Builds now require Cython >= 0.29.29 because of
* https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4609 (see #1143).
* PyPI wheels now include GDAL 3.5.2, PROJ 9.0.1, and GEOS 3.11.0.
* PyPI wheels are now available for Python 3.11.

1.9a2 (2022-06-10)
------------------

Deprecations:

- Fiona's API methods will accept feature and geometry dicts in 1.9.0, but this
  usage is deprecated. Instances of Feature and Geometry will be required in
  2.0.
- The precision keyword argument of fiona.transform.transform_geom is
  deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.
- Deprecated usage has been eliminated in the project. Fiona's tests pass when
  run with a -Werror::DeprecationWarning filter.

Changes:

- Fiona's FionaDeprecationWarning now sub-classes DeprecationWarning.
- Some test modules have beeen re-formatted using black.

New features:

- Fiona Collections now carry a context exit stack into which we can push fiona
  Envs and MemoryFiles (#1059).
- Fiona has a new CRS class, like rasterio's, which is compatible with the CRS
  dicts of previous versions (#714).

1.9a1 (2022-05-19)
------------------

Deprecations:

- The fiona.drivers() function has been deprecated and will be removed in
  version 2.0. It should be replaced by fiona.Env().
- The new fiona.meta module will be renamed to fiona.drivers in version 2.0.

Packaging:

- Source distributions contain no C source files and require Cython to create
  them from .pyx files (#1096).

Changes:

- Shims for various versions of GDAL have been removed and are replaced by
  Cython compilation conditions (#1093).
- Use of CURL_CA_BUNDLE environment variable is replaced by a more specific
  GDAL/PROJ_CURL_CA_BUNDLE (#1095).
- Fiona's feature accessors now return instances of fiona.model.Feature instead
  of Python dicts (#787). The Feature class is compatible with code that
  expects GeoJSON-like dicts but also provides id, geometry, and properties
  attributes. The last two of these are instances of fiona.model.Geometry and
  fiona.model.Properties.
- GDAL 3.1.0 is the minimum GDAL version.
- Drop Python 2, and establish Python 3.7 as the minimum version (#1079).
- Remove six and reduce footprint of fiona.compat (#985).

New features:

- The appropriate format driver can be detected from filename in write mode (#948).
- Driver metadata including dataset open and dataset and layer creations
  options are now exposed through methods of the fiona.meta module (#950).
- CRS WKT format support (#979).
- Add 'where' SQL clause to set attribute filter (#961, #1097).

Bug fixes:

- Env and Session classes have been updated for parity with rasterio and to
  resolve a credential refresh bug (#1055).

1.8.22 (2022-10-14)
-------------------

Builds now require Cython >= 0.29.29 because of
https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4609 (#1143).

1.8.21 (2022-02-07)
-------------------

Changes:

- Driver mode support tests have been made more general and less susceptible to
  driver quirks involving feature fields and coordinate values (#1060).
- OSError is raised on attempts to open a dataset in a Python file object in
  "a" mode (see #1027).
- Upgrade attrs, cython, etc to open up Python 3.10 support (#1049).

Bug fixes:

- Allow FieldSkipLogFilter to handle exception messages as well as strings
  (reported in #1035).
- Clean up VSI files left by MemoryFileBase, resolving #1041.
- Hard-coded "utf-8" collection encoding added in #423 has been removed
  (#1057).

1.8.20 (2021-05-31)
-------------------

Packaging:

- Wheels include GDAL 3.3.0 and GEOS 3.9.1.

Bug fixes:

- Allow use with click 8 and higher (#1015).

1.8.19 (2021-04-07)
-------------------

Packaging:

- Wheels include GDAL 3.2.1 and PROJ 7.2.1.

Bug fixes:

- In fiona/env.py the GDAL data path is now configured using set_gdal_config
  instead by setting the GDAL_DATA environment variable (#1007).
- Spurious iterator reset warnings have been eliminatged (#987).

1.8.18 (2020-11-17)
-------------------

- The precision option of transform has been fixed for the case of
  GeometryCollections (#971, #972).
- Added missing --co (creation) option to fio-load (#390).
- If the certifi package can be imported, its certificate store location will
  be passed to GDAL during import of fiona._env unless CURL_CA_BUNDLE is
  already set.
- Warn when feature fields named "" are found (#955).

1.8.17 (2020-09-09)
-------------------

- To fix issue #952 the fio-cat command no longer cuts feature geometries at
  the anti-meridian by default. A --cut-at-antimeridian option has been added
  to allow cutting of geometries in a geographic destination coordinate
  reference system.

1.8.16 (2020-09-04)
-------------------

- More OGR errors and warnings arising in calls to GDAL C API functions are
  surfaced (#946).
- A circular import introduced in some cases in 1.8.15 has been fixed (#945).

1.8.15 (2020-09-03)
-------------------

- Change shim functions to not return tuples (#942) as a solution for the
  packaging problem reported in #941.
- Raise a Python exception when VSIFOpenL fails (#937).

1.8.14 (2020-08-31)
-------------------

- When creating a new Collection in a MemoryFile with a default (random) name
  Fiona will attempt to use a format driver-supported file extension (#934).
  When initializing a MemoryFile with bytes of data formatted for a vector
  driver that requires a certain file name or extension, the user should
  continue to pass an appropriate filename and/or extension.
- Read support for FlatGeobuf has been enabled in the drvsupport module.
- The MemoryFile implementation has been improved so that it can support multi-part
  S3 downloads (#906). This is largely a port of code from rasterio.
- Axis ordering for results of fiona.transform was wrong when CRS were passed
  in the "EPSG:dddd" form (#919). This has been fixed by (#926).
- Allow implicit access to the only dataset in a ZipMemoryFile. The path
  argument of ZipMemoryFile.open() is now optional (#928).
- Improve support for datetime types: support milliseconds (#744), timezones (#914)
  and improve warnings if type is not supported by driver (#572).
- Fix "Failed to commit transaction" TransactionError for FileGDB driver.
- Load GDAL DLL dependencies on Python 3.8+ / Windows with add_dll_directory() (#851).
- Do not require optional properties (#848).
- Ensure that slice does not overflow available data (#884).
- Resolve issue when "ERROR 4: Unable to open EPSG support file gcs.csv." is raised on
  importing fiona (#897).
- Resolve issue resulting in possible mixed up fields names (affecting only DXF, GPX,
  GPSTrackMacker and DGN driver) (#916).
- Ensure crs_wkt is passed when writing to MemoryFile (#907).


1.8.13.post1 (2020-02-21)
-------------------------

- This release is being made to improve binary wheel compatibility with shapely
  1.7.0. There have been no changes to the fiona package code since 1.8.13.

1.8.13 (2019-12-05)
-------------------

- The Python version specs for argparse and ordereddict in 1.8.12 were wrong
  and have been corrected (#843).

1.8.12 (2019-12-04)
-------------------

- Specify Python versions for argparse, enum34, and ordereddict requirements
  (#842).

1.8.11 (2019-11-07)
-------------------

- Fix an access violation on Windows (#826).

1.8.10 (2019-11-07)
-------------------

Deprecations:

- Use of vfs keyword argument with open or listlayers has been previously noted
  as deprecated, but now triggers a deprecation warning.

Bug fixes:

- fiona.open() can now create new datasets using CRS URNs (#823).
- listlayers() now accepts file and Path objects, like open() (#825).
- Use new set_proj_search_path() function to set the PROJ data search path. For
  GDAL versions before 3.0 this sets the PROJ_LIB environment variable. For
  GDAL version 3.0 this calls OSRSetPROJSearchPaths(), which overrides
  PROJ_LIB.
- Remove old and unused _drivers extension module.
- Check for header.dxf file instead of pcs.csv when looking for installed GDAL
  data. The latter is gone with GDAL 3.0 but the former remains (#818).

1.8.9.post2 (2019-10-22)
------------------------

- The 1.8.9.post1 release introduced a bug affecting builds of the package from
  a source distribution using GDAL 2.x. This bug has been fixed in commit
  960568d.

1.8.9.post1 (2019-10-22)
------------------------

- A change has been made to the package setup script so that the shim module
  for GDAL 3 is used when building the package from a source distribution.
  There are no other changes to the package.

1.8.9 (2019-10-21)
------------------

- A shim module and support for GDAL 3.0 has been added. The package can now be
  built and used with GDAL 3.0 and PROJ 6.1 or 6.2. Note that the 1.8.9 wheels
  we will upload to PyPI will contain GDAL 2.4.2 and PROJ 4.9.3 as in the 1.8.8
  wheels.

1.8.8 (2019-09-25)
------------------

- The schema of geopackage files with a geometry type code of 3000 could not be
  reported using Fiona 1.8.7. This bug is fixed.

1.8.7 (2019-09-24)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Regression in handling of polygons with M values noted under version 1.8.5
  below was in fact not fixed then (see new report #789), but is fixed in
  version 1.8.7.
- Windows filenames containing "!" are now parsed correctly, fixing issue #742.

Upcoming changes:

- In version 1.9.0, the objects yielded when a Collection is iterated will be
  mutable mappings but will no longer be instances of Python's dict. Version
  1.9 is intended to be backwards compatible with 1.8 except where user code
  tests `isinstance(feature, dict)`. In version 2.0 the new Feature, Geometry,
  and Properties classes will become immutable mappings. See
  https://github.com/Toblerity/fiona-rfc/blob/master/rfc/0001-fiona-2-0-changes.md
  for more discussion of the upcoming changes for version 2.0.

1.8.6 (2019-03-18)
------------------

- The advertisement for JSON driver enablement in 1.8.5 was false (#176), but
  in this release they are ready for use.

1.8.5 (2019-03-15)
------------------

- GDAL seems to work best if GDAL_DATA is set as early as possible. Ideally it
  is set when building the library or in the environment before importing
  Fiona, but for wheels we patch GDAL_DATA into os.environ when fiona.env
  is imported. This resolves #731.
- A combination of bugs which allowed .cpg files to be overlooked has been
  fixed (#726).
- On entering a collection context (Collection.__enter__) a new anonymous GDAL
  environment is created if needed and entered. This makes `with
  fiona.open(...) as collection:` roughly equivalent to `with fiona.open(...)
  as collection, Env():`. This helps prevent bugs when Collections are created
  and then used later or in different scopes.
- Missing GDAL support for TopoJSON, GeoJSONSeq, and ESRIJSON has been enabled
  (#721).
- A regression in handling of polygons with M values (#724) has been fixed.
- Per-feature debug logging calls in OGRFeatureBuilder methods have been
  eliminated to improve feature writing performance (#718).
- Native support for datasets in Google Cloud Storage identified by "gs"
  resource names has been added (#709).
- Support has been added for triangle, polyhedral surface, and TIN geometry
  types (#679).
- Notes about using the MemoryFile and ZipMemoryFile classes has been added to
  the manual (#674).

1.8.4 (2018-12-10)
------------------

- 3D geometries can now be transformed with a specified precision (#523).
- A bug producing a spurious DriverSupportError for Shapefiles with a "time"
  field (#692) has been fixed.
- Patching of the GDAL_DATA environment variable was accidentally left in place
  in 1.8.3 and now has been removed.

1.8.3 (2018-11-30)
------------------

- The RASTERIO_ENV config environment marker this project picked up from
  Rasterio has been renamed to FIONA_ENV (#665).
- Options --gdal-data and --proj-data have been added to the fio-env command so
  that users of Rasterio wheels can get paths to set GDAL_DATA and PROJ_LIB
  environment variables.
- The unsuccessful attempt to make GDAL and PROJ support file discovery and
  configuration automatic within collection's crs and crs_wkt properties has
  been reverted.  Users must execute such code inside a `with Env()` block or
  set the GDAL_DATA and PROJ_LIB environment variables needed by GDAL.

1.8.2 (2018-11-19)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Raise FionaValueError when an iterator's __next__ is called and the session
  is found to be missing or inactive instead of passing a null pointer to
  OGR_L_GetNextFeature (#687).

1.8.1 (2018-11-15)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Add checks around OSRGetAuthorityName and OSRGetAuthorityCode calls that will
  log problems with looking up these items.
- Opened data sources are now released before we raise exceptions in
  WritingSession.start (#676). This fixes an issue with locked files on
  Windows.
- We now ensure that an Env instance exists when getting the crs or crs_wkt
  properties of a Collection (#673, #690). Otherwise, required GDAL and PROJ
  data files included in Fiona wheels can not be found.
- GDAL and PROJ data search has been refactored to improve testability (#678).
- In the project's Cython code, void* pointers have been replaced with proper
  GDAL types (#672).
- Pervasive warning level log messages about ENCODING creation options (#668)
  have been eliminated.

1.8.0 (2018-10-31)
------------------

This is the final 1.8.0 release. Thanks, everyone!

Bug fixes:

- We cpdef Session.stop so that it has a C version that can be called safely
  from __dealloc__, fixing a PyPy issue (#659, #553).

1.8rc1 (2018-10-26)
-------------------

There are no changes in 1.8rc1 other than more test standardization and the
introduction of a temporary test_collection_legacy.py module to support the
build of fully tested Python 2.7 macosx wheels on Travis-CI.

1.8b2 (2018-10-23)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- The ensure_env_with_credentials decorator will no longer clobber credentials
  of the outer environment. This fixes a bug reported to the Rasterio project
  and which also existed in Fiona.
- An unused import of the packaging module and the dependency have been 
  removed (#653).
- The Env class logged to the 'rasterio' hierarchy instead of 'fiona'. This
  mistake has been corrected (#646).
- The Mapping abstract base class is imported from collections.abc when
  possible (#647).

Refactoring:

- Standardization of the tests on pytest functions and fixtures continues and
  is nearing completion (#648, #649, #650, #651, #652).

1.8b1 (2018-10-15)
------------------

Deprecations:

- Collection slicing has been deprecated and will be prohibited in a future
  version.

Bug fixes:

- Rasterio CRS objects passed to transform module methods will be converted
  to dicts as needed (#590).
- Implicitly convert curve geometries to their linear approximations rather
  than failing (#617).
- Migrated unittest test cases in test_collection.py and test_layer.py to the
  use of the standard data_dir and path_coutwildrnp_shp fixtures (#616).
- Root logger configuration has been removed from all test scripts (#615).
- An AWS session is created for the CLI context Env only if explicitly
  requested, matching the behavior of Rasterio's CLI (#635).
- Dependency on attrs is made explicit.
- Other dependencies are pinned to known good versions in requirements files.
- Unused arguments have been removed from the Env constructor (#637).

Refactoring:

- A with_context_env decorator has been added and used to set up the GDAL
  environment for CLI commands. The command functions themselves are now
  simplified.

1.8a3 (2018-10-01)
------------------

Deprecations:

- The ``fiona.drivers()`` context manager is officially deprecated. All
  users should switch to ``fiona.Env()``, which registers format drivers and
  manages GDAL configuration in a reversible manner.

Bug fixes:

- The Collection class now filters log messages about skipped fields to
  a maximum of one warning message per field (#627).
- The boto3 module is only imported when needed (#507, #629).
- Compatibility with Click 7.0 is achieved (#633).
- Use of %r instead of %s in a debug() call prevents UnicodeDecodeErrors
  (#620).

1.8a2 (2018-07-24)
------------------

New features:

- 64-bit integers are the now the default for int type fields (#562, #564).
- 'http', 's3', 'zip+http', and 'zip+s3' URI schemes for datasets are now
  supported (#425, #426).
- We've added a ``MemoryFile`` class which supports formatted in-memory
  feature collections (#501).
- Added support for GDAL 2.x boolean field sub-type (#531).
- A new ``fio rm`` command makes it possible to cleanly remove multi-file
  datasets (#538).
- The geometry type in a feature collection is more flexible. We can now
  specify not only a single geometry type, but a sequence of permissible types,
  or "Any" to permit any geometry type (#539).
- Support for GDAL 2.2+ null fields has been added (#554).
- The new ``gdal_open_vector()`` function of our internal API provides much
  improved error handling (#557).

Bug fixes:

- The bug involving OrderedDict import on Python 2.7 has been fixed (#533).
- An ``AttributeError`` raised when the ``--bbox`` option of fio-cat is used
  with more than one input file has been fixed (#543, #544).
- Obsolete and derelict fiona.tool module has been removed.
- Revert the change in 0a2bc7c that discards Z in geometry types when a
  collection's schema is reported (#541).
- Require six version 1.7 or higher (#550).
- A regression related to "zip+s3" URIs has been fixed.
- Debian's GDAL data locations are now searched by default (#583).

1.8a1 (2017-11-06)
------------------

New features:

- Each call of ``writerecords()`` involves one or more transactions of up to
  20,000 features each. This improves performance when writing GeoPackage files
  as the previous transaction size was only 200 features (#476, #491).

Packaging:

- Fiona's Cython source files have been refactored so that there are no longer
  separate extension modules for GDAL 1.x and GDAL 2.x. Instead there is a base
  extension module based on GDAL 2.x and shim modules for installations that
  use GDAL 1.x.

1.7.11.post1 (2018-01-08)
-------------------------

- This post-release adds missing expat (and thereby GPX format) support to
  the included GDAL library (still version 2.2.2).

1.7.11 (2017-12-14)
-------------------

- The ``encoding`` keyword argument for ``fiona.open()``, which is intended
  to allow a caller to override a data source's own and possibly erroneous
  encoding, has not been working (#510, #512). The problem is that we weren't
  always setting GDAL open or config options before opening the data sources.
  This bug is resolved by a number of commits in the maint-1.7 branch and
  the fix is demonstrated in tests/test_encoding.py.
- An ``--encoding`` option has been added to fio-load to enable creation of
  encoded shapefiles with an accompanying .cpg file (#499, #517).

1.7.10.post1 (2017-10-30)
-------------------------

- A post-release has been made to fix a problem with macosx wheels uploaded
  to PyPI.

1.7.10 (2017-10-26)
-------------------

Bug fixes:

- An extraneous printed line from the ``rio cat --layers`` validator has been
  removed (#478).

Packaging:

- Official OS X and Manylinux1 wheels (on PyPI) for this release will be
  compatible with Shapely 1.6.2 and Rasterio 1.0a10 wheels.

1.7.9.post1 (2017-08-21)
------------------------

This release introduces no changes in the Fiona package. It upgrades GDAL
from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 in wheels that we publish to the Python Package Index.

1.7.9 (2017-08-17)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Acquire the GIL for GDAL error callback functions to prevent crashes when
  GDAL errors occur when the GIL has been released by user code.
- Sync and flush layers when closing even when the number of features is not
  precisely known (#467).

1.7.8 (2017-06-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Provide all arguments needed by CPLError based exceptions (#456).

1.7.7 (2017-06-05)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Switch logger `warn()` (deprecated) calls to `warning()`.
- Replace all relative imports and cimports in Cython modules with absolute
  imports (#450).
- Avoid setting `PROJ_LIB` to a non-existent directory (#439).

1.7.6 (2017-04-26)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Fall back to `share/proj` for PROJ_LIB (#440).
- Replace every call to `OSRDestroySpatialReference()` with `OSRRelease()`,
  fixing the GPKG driver crasher reported in #441 (#443).
- Add a `DriverIOError` derived from `IOError` to use for driver-specific
  errors such as the GeoJSON driver's refusal to overwrite existing files.
  Also we now ensure that when this error is raised by `fiona.open()` any
  created read or write session is deleted, this eliminates spurious 
  exceptions on teardown of broken `Collection` objects (#437, #444).

1.7.5 (2017-03-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Opening a data file in read (the default) mode with `fiona.open()` using the
  the `driver` or `drivers` keyword arguments (to specify certain format 
  drivers) would sometimes cause a crash on Windows due to improperly
  terminated lists of strings (#428). The fix: Fiona's buggy `string_list()`
  has been replaced by GDAL's `CSLAddString()`.

1.7.4 (2017-02-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- OGR's EsriJSON detection fails when certain keys aren't found in the first
  6000 bytes of data passed to `BytesCollection` (#422). A .json file extension
  is now explicitly given to the in-memory file behind `BytesCollection` when
  the `driver='GeoJSON'` keyword argument is given (#423). 

1.7.3 (2017-02-14)
------------------

Roses are red.
Tan is a pug.
Software regression's
the most embarrassing bug.

Bug fixes:

- Use __stdcall for GDAL error handling callback on Windows as in Rasterio.
- Turn on latent support for zip:// URLs in rio-cat and rio-info (#421).
- The 1.7.2 release broke support for zip files with absolute paths (#418).
  This regression has been fixed with tests to confirm.

1.7.2 (2017-01-27)
------------------

Future Deprecation:

- `Collection.__next__()` is buggy in that it can lead to duplication of 
  features when used in combination with `Collection.filter()` or
  `Collection.__iter__()`. It will be removed in Fiona 2.0. Please check for
  usage of this deprecated feature by running your tests or programs with
  `PYTHONWARNINGS="always:::fiona"` or `-W"always:::fiona"` and switch from
  `next(collection)` to `next(iter(collection))` (#301).

Bug fix:

- Zipped streams of bytes can be accessed by `BytesCollection` (#318).

1.7.1.post1 (2016-12-23)
------------------------
- New binary wheels using version 1.2.0 of sgillies/frs-wheel-builds. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/blob/master/CHANGES.txt.

1.7.1 (2016-11-16)
------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Prevent Fiona from stumbling over 'Z', 'M', and 'ZM' geometry types
  introduced in GDAL 2.1 (#384). Fiona 1.7.1 doesn't add explicit support for
  these types, they are coerced to geometry types 1-7 ('Point', 'LineString',
  etc.)
- Raise an `UnsupportedGeometryTypeError` when a bogus or unsupported 
  geometry type is encountered in a new collection's schema or elsewhere
  (#340).
- Enable `--precision 0` for fio-cat (#370).
- Prevent datetime exceptions from unnecessarily stopping collection iteration
  by yielding `None` (#385)
- Replace log.warn calls with log.warning calls (#379).
- Print an error message if neither gdal-config or `--gdalversion` indicate
  a GDAL C API version when running `setup.py` (#364).
- Let dict-like subclasses through CRS type checks (#367).

1.7.0post2 (2016-06-15)
-----------------------

Packaging: define extension modules for 'clean' and 'config' targets (#363).

1.7.0post1 (2016-06-15)
-----------------------

Packaging: No files are copied for the 'clean' setup target (#361, #362).

1.7.0 (2016-06-14)
------------------

The C extension modules in this library can now be built and used with either
a 1.x or 2.x release of the GDAL library. Big thanks to René Buffat for
leading this effort.

Refactoring:

- The `ogrext1.pyx` and `ogrext2.pyx` files now use separate
  C APIs defined in `ogrext1.pxd` and `ogrex2.pxd`. The other extension
  modules have been refactored so that they do not depend on either of these
  modules and use subsets of the GDAL/OGR API compatible with both GDAL 1.x and
  2.x (#359).

Packaging:

- Source distributions now contain two different sources for the
  `ogrext` extension module. The `ogrext1.c` file will be used with GDAL 1.x
  and the `ogrext2.c` file will be used with GDAL 2.x.

1.7b2 (2016-06-13)
------------------

- New feature: enhancement of the `--layer` option for fio-cat and fio-dump
  to allow separate layers of one or more multi-layer input files to be
  selected (#349).

1.7b1 (2016-06-10)
------------------

- New feature: support for GDAL version 2+ (#259).
- New feature: a new fio-calc CLI command (#273).
- New feature: `--layer` options for fio-info (#316) and fio-load (#299).
- New feature: a `--no-parse` option for fio-collect that lets a careful user
  avoid extra JSON serialization and deserialization (#306).
- Bug fix: `+wktext` is now preserved when serializing CRS from WKT to PROJ.4
  dicts (#352).
- Bug fix: a small memory leak when opening a collection has been fixed (#337).
- Bug fix: internal unicode errors now result in a log message and a 
  `UnicodeError` exception, not a `TypeError` (#356).

1.6.4 (2016-05-06)
------------------
- Raise ImportError if the active GDAL library version is >= 2.0 instead of
  failing unpredictably (#338, #341). Support for GDAL>=2.0 is coming in
  Fiona 1.7.

1.6.3.post1 (2016-03-27)
------------------------
- No changes to the library in this post-release version, but there is a
  significant change to the distributions on PyPI: to help make Fiona more
  compatible with Shapely on OS X, the GDAL shared library included in the
  macosx (only) binary wheels now statically links the GEOS library. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/issues/5.

1.6.3 (2015-12-22)
------------------
- Daytime has been decreasing in the Northern Hemisphere, but is now
  increasing again as it should.
- Non-UTF strings were being passed into OGR functions in some situations
  and on Windows this would sometimes crash a Python process (#303). Fiona
  now raises errors derived from UnicodeError when field names or field
  values can't be encoded.

1.6.2 (2015-09-22)
------------------
- Providing only PROJ4 representations in the dataset meta property resulted in
  loss of CRS information when using the `fiona.open(..., **src.meta) as dst`
  pattern (#265). This bug has been addressed by adding a crs_wkt item to the`
  meta property and extending the `fiona.open()` and the collection constructor
  to look for and prioritize this keyword argument.

1.6.1 (2015-08-12)
------------------
- Bug fix: Fiona now deserializes JSON-encoded string properties provided by
  the OGR GeoJSON driver (#244, #245, #246).
- Bug fix: proj4 data was not copied properly into binary distributions due to
  a typo (#254).

- Allow users to specify width of shapefile text fields (#20).

0.8 (2012-02-21)
----------------

- Manage one iterator per collection/session.
- Added a read-only bounds property.

0.7 (2012-01-29)
----------------
- Initial timezone-naive support for date, time, and datetime fields. Don't use
  these field types if you can avoid them. RFC 3339 datetimes in a string field
  are much better.

0.6.2 (2012-01-10)
------------------
- Diagnose and set the driver property of collection in read mode.
- Fail if collection paths are not to files. Multi-collection workspaces are
  a (maybe) TODO.
