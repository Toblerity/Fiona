Changes
=======

All issue numbers are relative to https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/issues.

1.7.8 (2017-06-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Provide all arguments needed by CPLError based exceptions (#456).

1.7.7 (2017-06-05)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Switch logger `warn()` (deprecated) calls to `warning()`.
- Replace all relative imports and cimports in Cython modules with absolute
  imports (#450).
- Avoid setting `PROJ_LIB` to a non-existent directory (#439).

1.7.6 (2017-04-26)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Fall back to `share/proj` for PROJ_LIB (#440).
- Replace every call to `OSRDestroySpatialReference()` with `OSRRelease()`,
  fixing the GPKG driver crasher reported in #441 (#443).
- Add a `DriverIOError` derived from `IOError` to use for driver-specific
  errors such as the GeoJSON driver's refusal to overwrite existing files.
  Also we now ensure that when this error is raised by `fiona.open()` any
  created read or write session is deleted, this eliminates spurious 
  exceptions on teardown of broken `Collection` objects (#437, #444).

1.7.5 (2017-03-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Opening a data file in read (the default) mode with `fiona.open()` using the
  the `driver` or `drivers` keyword arguments (to specify certain format 
  drivers) would sometimes cause a crash on Windows due to improperly
  terminated lists of strings (#428). The fix: Fiona's buggy `string_list()`
  has been replaced by GDAL's `CSLAddString()`.

1.7.4 (2017-02-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- OGR's EsriJSON detection fails when certain keys aren't found in the first
  6000 bytes of data passed to `BytesCollection` (#422). A .json file extension
  is now explicitly given to the in-memory file behind `BytesCollection` when
  the `driver='GeoJSON'` keyword argument is given (#423). 

1.7.3 (2017-02-14)
------------------

Roses are red.
Tan is a pug.
Software regression's
the most embarrassing bug.

Bug fixes:

- Use __stdcall for GDAL error handling callback on Windows as in Rasterio.
- Turn on latent support for zip:// URLs in rio-cat and rio-info (#421).
- The 1.7.2 release broke support for zip files with absolute paths (#418).
  This regression has been fixed with tests to confirm.

1.7.2 (2017-01-27)
------------------

Future Deprecation:

- `Collection.__next__()` is buggy in that it can lead to duplication of 
  features when used in combination with `Collection.filter()` or
  `Collection.__iter__()`. It will be removed in Fiona 2.0. Please check for
  usage of this deprecated feature by running your tests or programs with
  `PYTHONWARNINGS="always:::fiona"` or `-W"always:::fiona"` and switch from
  `next(collection)` to `next(iter(collection))` (#301).

Bug fix:

- Zipped streams of bytes can be accessed by `BytesCollection` (#318).

1.7.1.post1 (2016-12-23)
------------------------
- New binary wheels using version 1.2.0 of sgillies/frs-wheel-builds. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/blob/master/CHANGES.txt.

1.7.1 (2016-11-16)
------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Prevent Fiona from stumbling over 'Z', 'M', and 'ZM' geometry types
  introduced in GDAL 2.1 (#384). Fiona 1.7.1 doesn't add explicit support for
  these types, they are coerced to geometry types 1-7 ('Point', 'LineString',
  etc.)
- Raise an `UnsupportedGeometryTypeError` when a bogus or unsupported 
  geometry type is encountered in a new collection's schema or elsewhere
  (#340).
- Enable `--precision 0` for fio-cat (#370).
- Prevent datetime exceptions from unnecessarily stopping collection iteration
  by yielding `None` (#385)
- Replace log.warn calls with log.warning calls (#379).
- Print an error message if neither gdal-config or `--gdalversion` indicate
  a GDAL C API version when running `setup.py` (#364).
- Let dict-like subclasses through CRS type checks (#367).

1.7.0post2 (2016-06-15)
-----------------------

Packaging: define extension modules for 'clean' and 'config' targets (#363).

1.7.0post1 (2016-06-15)
-----------------------

Packaging: No files are copied for the 'clean' setup target (#361, #362).

1.7.0 (2016-06-14)
------------------

The C extension modules in this library can now be built and used with either
a 1.x or 2.x release of the GDAL library. Big thanks to René Buffat for
leading this effort.

Refactoring:

- The `ogrext1.pyx` and `ogrext2.pyx` files now use separate
  C APIs defined in `ogrext1.pxd` and `ogrex2.pxd`. The other extension
  modules have been refactored so that they do not depend on either of these
  modules and use subsets of the GDAL/OGR API compatible with both GDAL 1.x and
  2.x (#359).

Packaging:

- Source distributions now contain two different sources for the
  `ogrext` extension module. The `ogrext1.c` file will be used with GDAL 1.x
  and the `ogrext2.c` file will be used with GDAL 2.x.

1.7b2 (2016-06-13)
------------------

- New feature: enhancement of the `--layer` option for fio-cat and fio-dump
  to allow separate layers of one or more multi-layer input files to be
  selected (#349).

1.7b1 (2016-06-10)
------------------

- New feature: support for GDAL version 2+ (#259).
- New feature: a new fio-calc CLI command (#273).
- New feature: `--layer` options for fio-info (#316) and fio-load (#299).
- New feature: a `--no-parse` option for fio-collect that lets a careful user
  avoid extra JSON serialization and deserialization (#306).
- Bug fix: `+wktext` is now preserved when serializing CRS from WKT to PROJ.4
  dicts (#352).
- Bug fix: a small memory leak when opening a collection has been fixed (#337).
- Bug fix: internal unicode errors now result in a log message and a 
  `UnicodeError` exception, not a `TypeError` (#356).

1.6.4 (2016-05-06)
------------------
- Raise ImportError if the active GDAL library version is >= 2.0 instead of
  failing unpredictably (#338, #341). Support for GDAL>=2.0 is coming in
  Fiona 1.7.

1.6.3.post1 (2016-03-27)
------------------------
- No changes to the library in this post-release version, but there is a
  significant change to the distributions on PyPI: to help make Fiona more
  compatible with Shapely on OS X, the GDAL shared library included in the
  macosx (only) binary wheels now statically links the GEOS library. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/issues/5.

1.6.3 (2015-12-22)
------------------
- Daytime has been decreasing in the Northern Hemisphere, but is now
  increasing again as it should.
- Non-UTF strings were being passed into OGR functions in some situations
  and on Windows this would sometimes crash a Python process (#303). Fiona
  now raises errors derived from UnicodeError when field names or field
  values can't be encoded.

1.6.2 (2015-09-22)
------------------
- Providing only PROJ4 representations in the dataset meta property resulted in
  loss of CRS information when using the `fiona.open(..., **src.meta) as dst`
  pattern (#265). This bug has been addressed by adding a crs_wkt item to the`
  meta property and extending the `fiona.open()` and the collection constructor
  to look for and prioritize this keyword argument.

1.6.1 (2015-08-12)
------------------
- Bug fix: Fiona now deserializes JSON-encoded string properties provided by
  the OGR GeoJSON driver (#244, #245, #246).
- Bug fix: proj4 data was not copied properly into binary distributions due to
  a typo (#254).

0.12 (2013-04-15)
-----------------

0.11 (2013-04-14)
-----------------
- Cythonize .pyx files (#34).
- Work with or around OGR's internal recoding of record data (#35).

- Silence the logger in ogrext.so (can be overridden).
- Allow user specification of record field encoding (like 'Windows-1252' for
  Natural Earth shapefiles) to help when OGR can't detect it.

0.9 (2013-03-06)
----------------

- Allow users to specify width of shapefile text fields (#20).

0.8 (2012-02-21)
----------------
- Replaced .opened attribute with .closed (product of collection() is always
  opened). Also a __del__() which will close a Collection, but still not to be
  depended upon.
- Added writerecords method.
- Added a record buffer and better counting of records in a collection.
- Manage one iterator per collection/session.
- Added a read-only bounds property.

0.7 (2012-01-29)
----------------
- Initial timezone-naive support for date, time, and datetime fields. Don't use
  these field types if you can avoid them. RFC 3339 datetimes in a string field
  are much better.

0.6.2 (2012-01-10)
------------------
- Diagnose and set the driver property of collection in read mode.
- Fail if collection paths are not to files. Multi-collection workspaces are
  a (maybe) TODO.

----------------
- Rename WorldMill to Fiona.

0.1.1 (2008-12-04)
------------------
- Support for features with no geometry.
