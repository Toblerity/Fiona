CHANGES
=======

0.9 (2012-)
-----------
- Accessing file metadata (crs, schema, bounds) on never inspected closed files
  returns None without exceptions.
- Add a dict of supported_drivers and their supported modes.
- Raise ValueError for unsupported drivers and modes.
- Remove asserts from ogrext.pyx.
- Add validate_record method to collections.

0.8 (2012-02-21)
----------------
- Replaced .opened attribute with .closed (product of collection() is always
  opened). Also a __del__() which will close a Collection, but still not to be
  depended upon.
- Added writerecords method.
- Added a record buffer and better counting of records in a collection.
- Manage one iterator per collection/session.
- Added a read-only bounds property.

0.7 (2012-01-29)
----------------
- Initial timezone-naive support for date, time, and datetime fields. Don't use
  these field types if you can avoid them. RFC 3339 datetimes in a string field
  are much better.

0.6.2 (2012-01-10)
------------------
- Diagnose and set the driver property of collection in read mode.
- Fail if collection paths are not to files. Multi-collection workspaces are
  a (maybe) TODO.

0.6.1 (2012-01-06)
------------------
- Handle the case of undefined crs for disk collections.

0.6 (2012-01-05)
----------------
- Support for collection coordinate reference systems based on Proj4.
- Redirect OGR warnings and errors to the Fiona log.
- Assert that pointers returned from the ograpi functions are not NULL before
  using.

0.5 (2011-12-19)
----------------
- Support for reading and writing collections of any geometry type.
- Feature and Geometry classes replaced by mappings (dicts).
- Removal of Workspace class.

0.2 (2011-09-16)
----------------
- Rename WorldMill to Fiona.

0.1.1 (2008-12-04)
------------------
- Support for features with no geometry.
