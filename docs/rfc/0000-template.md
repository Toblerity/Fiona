Status: draft

## Abstract

This document is a template for future requests for comments (RFC).

## Status

This is a proposal draft.

## Introduction

Requests for comments (RFC) are more useful if they have consistent structure.
This document lays out the basic structure for project RFCs. It may be changed
by a future RFC.

## Details

RFCs are to be formatted using Markdown and kept under docs/rfc. RFC docs shall
be named like `0000-template.md`, `0001-the-next-rfc.md`, &c so that docs can
be easily sorted in order of creation.

A RFC shall have a title formatted like the one at the top of this template, 6
metadata fields (RFC number, author, date, obsoleted by, obsoletes, and
status), and 6 sections: abstract, status, introduction, implementation
details, considerations, and references. If the RFC does not make a previous
RFC obsolete or has not been made obsolete by a subsequent RFC, these metadata
fields can be omitted.

## Considerations

This RFC has no compatibility or security considerations. If it did propose a
breaking change for the API or project access, that would be discussed here.

## References

This RFC template has no references, but if it did, they would be listed here.
